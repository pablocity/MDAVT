# MDAVT - Multidimentional Data Visualization Tool

## Description

The aim of this project is to develop a tool for visualizing multidimentional data from UCI machine learning repository. It should be possible to visualize the data in parallel coordinates, 2D plane (selected two dimensions of the data set), 2D plane (dimensions defined as a linear combination of original dimensions)

## Basic requirements

- A variety of text data formats should be supported
- Data visualization should be configurable and controlled with some parameters
- It should be possible to export the rendered plots as bitmaps or in a form of data series
- The tool should be extendable

## Technological Stack

- Python (probably)
- Git as version control tool
- Github Actions (CI / CD)
