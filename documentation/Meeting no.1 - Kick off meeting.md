# Meeting no.1 - Kick off meeting

- 

- In case of any doubts, between the regular meetings, the e-mail contact is possible. There is a possibility of arranging zoom meeting online

- It is recommended to ask questions about requirements, because there may occur a situation when there is more work done, that needed to be in the first place. Just because of lack of communication with the client
