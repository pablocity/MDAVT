# Meeting no.2 - Architecture

- Decide about the way of holding the data: class, container, parameter

- Consider another way of implementing 2D plane linear combination instead of inheriting from chosen cords

- Parallel and Parallel Coordinates - reconsider, if these classes can be merged. It would much more clear

- Reconsider usage of 2 independent renderers, likewise, consider merging them into one class

- Extending the functionality of a class via inheritance is not optimal, consider abbreviation or composition. Research design patterns

- Next meeting, prepare a prototype of the application
