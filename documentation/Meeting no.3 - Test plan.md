# Meeting no.3 - Test plan

- The document contains a lot of text, but lacks in substance

- Too much generalization

- There are a lot of obvious statements which do not require attention and explanation

- The document lacks time schedule

- There should be explained specific, precise cases which can occur and then the explanation, how are they going to be tested and managed

- Even if the code isn't already done, the test can already be thought about and prepared. The testers can ask developers if their ideas about the tests make sense in practice

- The Agile method concerns development, not testing, this mistake should be erased
  
  # Risk analysis:
  
  - Each of the risks should be numerated for easier usage of the document
  
  - "Risk avoiding" is not a completely accurate statement. There is only effort of developers to mitigate the risk and intensification of testing by the testers to decrease the probability of a mistake
  
  - In a week time, according to feedback, the improved version of the document can be sent

- Next meeting, present the application UI. The best way of gathering requirements and feedback is presenting the prototype
